Introduction:
Dyslexia is a neurodevelopment disorder that affects an individual's ability to read, write, and comprehend written language. To support individuals with dyslexia, we present DyslexiScan, a revolutionary iOS app powered by Apple's Vision AI and Open AI (Language Model) to enhance the reading experience for those facing dyslexia-related challenges.
Understanding Dyslexia:
Dyslexia is characterised by difficulties in decoding words, recognising spelling patterns, and comprehending written language. It can affect self-esteem and limit access to educational and professional opportunities. DyslexiScan aims to bridge this gap by making text more accessible and understandable for individuals without dyslexia.
DyslexiScan Features:
1. Text Recognition: DyslexiScan utilizes the power of Apple's Vision AI to recognise and extract text from images in real-time. Users can simply point their device's camera at a book, document, or any printed material, and DyslexiScan will instantly identify and display the text on the screen.
2. Dyslexic Text Conversion: DyslexiScan doesn't stop at recognition. It leverages on Open ai GPT-Model to convert recognised text from its dyslexic format to a more non-dyslexic-friendly version. The app transforms complex words written by dyslexic person into simpler, more straightforward alternatives, making it easier for user's without dyslexia to read and understand text writen by dyslexic person.
3. Text-to-Speech: For an inclusive reading experience, DyslexiScan offers a built-in text-to-speech feature. Users can tap on button, and the app will read it aloud. This feature is valuable for auditory learners and those who benefit from simultaneous visual and auditory input.
4. Save and Share: DyslexiScan allows users to copy converted text for future reference or share them with teachers, colleagues, or friends. The app's sharing capabilities promote accessibility and collaboration.
